# dalfolloilerplate
The boilerplate I use for my webdev projects using pug.js, webpack, sass y mucho mas !

## Setup 
To setup the boilerplate, you just need to install the npm packages, and you're good to go. 
`npm install`

Then, you can wake node.js up, like so for development: 
`npm start`

And for production: 
`npm run build`
